Upon return, the server is binded and listening to port \c inPortNumber using a queue of \c inMinPending pending connections. Note that the exact length of this queue may be operating system dependent (experience has shown that it is usually longer than specified on macosx and linux). For the server to start accepting these connections, the user must call method TCPServer::run.

/*! \brief Delete thread pool.

Assuming that the caller has halted the server (using TCPServer::halt) and waited for the server threads to complete any pending connections (using TCPServer::wait), this method deletes the allocated thread pool. In debug mode, if any thread is found still running, the method aborts the application with a descriptive fatal error message.

A good strategy is to always define a destructor in the derived server class, and to make this destructor waits for server termination. For instance:
\code
class MyServer : public Socket::TCPServer {
	...
	~MyServer(void) {wait();}
	...
};
\endcode

\attention If the destructor in the derived server class (e.g. MyServer above) does not wait for thread termination, the potential hazardous situation is that the runtime system will have deleted all of its members before calling this destructor (in C++, class destructors are called in reversed sequence). Thus, a still running server thread could access deleted members with unpredictable end unexpected results. Moreover, if a new connection is accepted in the meantime, then the running thread will crash the application with a cryptic "pure virtual method called" message that results from a call to a main method that no longer exists in this object. So beware!

/*! \brief Stop accepting incomming connections.

This method requests cancellation for every allocated server thread in order to make them stop accepting new connections. Threads termination is asynchronous; they terminate either after they complete their current connection or after the \c inMaxHaltDelay delay that was specified in the call to TCPServer::run. 

In order to minimize halting delay, whenever it is safe to terminate a connection from within TCPServer::main, the user should make calls to method ServerThread::shouldTerminate to determine whether it should close the connection and terminate execution early.

/*! \brief Start accepting incomming connections.

Upon return, this method has added \c inThreads new threads to the server's thread pool. These new threads start accepting incomming connections immediately, and until some thread calls method TCPServer::halt. Incomming connections are processed through calls to virtual function TCPServer::main which needs to be overloaded in a sub-class. Halt requests will be honored at least every \c inMaxHaltDelay seconds (default=1), or after a connection terminates.

This method can be called any number of times to increase the size of the thread pool. 

\attention if the server was constructed using the default constructor, methods TCPServer::bind and TCPServer::listen must be called prior to calling this method. Otherwise, no incomming connection will never be accepted, nor any error raised. Any error during the initialization of the new threads raises a Socket::Exception.

This method will wait for the termination of every server thread. If method TCPServer::halt was previously executed, then the server threads will terminate after the longer of either the time required to complete their current connections or the \c inMaxHaltDelay delay that was specified in the call to TCPServer::run.
