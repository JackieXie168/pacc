		\ingroup Threading
		
		This class incapsulates a mutex with classic Mutex::lock, Mutex::unlock, and Mutex::tryLock methods. A thread that already has acquired the mutex should not lock it again because this could lead to a deadlock. A thread should only unlock a mutex that is has lock previously (the mutex is not recursive). Otherwise the behavior of the mutex is undetermined (OS specific). 
		
		This class should be compatible with any Unix that supports POSIX threads, as well as any version of Windows. It has been tested under Linux, MacOS X and Windows 2000/XP.
