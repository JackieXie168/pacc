Otherwise, it assumes that the caller has already locked the mutex (using Semaphore::lock) and that it is responsible for unlocking it.

/*! \brief Try to acquire one ressource, but don't block if ressources are exhausted. 
\return True if resource was acquired, false otherwise.

This method decrements a positive semaphore count and returns true. If count is negative or null, it returns false immediately, without waiting for an available resource. If argument \c inLock is true (default), it will first lock the embedded mutex (using the lock method) to protect the internal count. Otherwise, it assumes that the caller has already locked the mutex (using Semaphore::lock) and that it is responsible for unlocking it.

/*! \brief Wait up to \c inMaxTime seconds to acquire one resource. 
\return True if resource was acquired, false if timed out.

This method decrements a positive semaphore count and returns true. When count is negative or null, it waits up to \c inMaxTime seconds for a resource to become available. If one becomes available before time out, then the method returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. 

If argument \c inLock is true (default), it will first lock the embedded mutex (using the lock method) to protect the internal count. Otherwise, it assumes that the caller has already locked the mutex (using Semaphore::lock) and that it is responsible for unlocking it.

A negative or null time out (default) means that the method should wait indefinitely (for a null time out, use method Semaphore::tryWait).
