%PACC is a collection of Portable Agile C++ Classes that can be retrieved at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pacc/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pacc/</a>. It is said to be portable because it can run on both Unix and Windows platforms. In general, the %PACC classes have been tested and used under Linux, MacOSX, and Windows 2000/XP. They are also known to compile succesfully on AIX.
