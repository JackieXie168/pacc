/*! \brief Delete thread.

Assuming that the caller has canceled the thread and waited for its termination, this method detaches the thread and deletes its native structure. In debug mode, if the thread is found still running, then the method aborts the application with a descriptive fatal error message.

A good strategy is to always define a destructor in the derived class, and to make this destructor wait for thread termination. For instance:
\code
class MyThread : public Threading::Thread {
    ...
    ~MyThread(void) {wait();}
    ...
};
\endcode

The calling thread can also use method Thread::cancel to request early termination for this thread. But thread cancellation is asynchronous, it will be deferred to the next cancellation point. From within Thread::main, in order to allow rapid thread cancellation, method Thread::makeCancellationPoint should be called as often as possible whenever it is safe to cancel the thread. A running thread that omits cancellation points and never terminates will block the calling thread of this method indefinitely.

\attention If the destructor in the derived thread class (e.g. MyThread above) does not wait for thread termination, the potential hazardous situation is that the runtime system will have deleted all of its members before calling this destructor (in C++, class destructors are called in reversed sequence). Thus, the still running thread could access deleted data members with unpredictable and unexpected results. So beware!

Before deleting a cancelled thread, the caller should always wait for thread termination. 

The caller should always lock the thread (using the lock method) prior to asking for cancellation. If it wishes to wait immediately for thread termination, it should keep the thread locked and call the wait method with argument false (see Thread::wait).
