ABOUT
=====

PACC is a collection of Portable Agile C++ Classes that can be retrieved at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pacc/. It is said to be portable because it can
run on both Unix and Windows platforms. In general, the PACC classes have been
tested and used under Linux, MacOSX, and Windows 2000/XP. They are also known to
compile succesfully on AIX.

The PACC collection is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
