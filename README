It can be retrieved from the following anonymous CVS pserver repository::pserver:anonymous@manitou.gel.ulaval.ca:/Users/parizeau/CVSby checking out one of the following CVS modules:  - "pacc-base" for the basic PACC classes (Math, Socket, Threading, Util, and XML)  - "pacc-math" for the mathematical classes (Matrix & Vector)  - "pacc-socket" for the socket classes (TCP & UDP)  - "pacc-thread" for the threading classes (Threads & Semaphores)  - "pacc-util" for miscellaneous utility classes  - "pacc-xml" for the XML classes (simple DOM package)  - "pacc-fuzzy" for the fuzzy set and fuzzy associative memory classes  - "pacc-mlp" for the multilayer perceptron classes  - "pacc-full" for all of the aboveYou can also checkout module "pacc-lib" if you want to build libraries for the basic PACC classes. You then get the equivalent of "pacc-base" but with automake/autoconf files.Another alternative is to retrieve the latest distribution of "pacc-lib" at the following address: <http://manitou.gel.ulaval.ca/~parizeau/pacc-1.0.0.tar.gz>.The PACC collection is said to be portable because it can run on both Unix and Windows platforms. In general, the PACC classes have been tested and used under Linux, MacOSX, and Windows 2000/XP.The PACC collection is free software; you can redistribute it and/ormodify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General PublicLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; eitherversion 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.It is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty ofMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
